This PHP script (link.php) writes a link to a file (link.txt) from a client machine which can be executed on a server in firefox from a bash script (linkff.sh).

link.sh can also execute the link in firefox automatically, but you'll need to finagle some user settings to make this work.

This is useful if you want to quickly move links from your laptop to an HTPC.

INSTALLATION

Dependencies: apache, php5, firefox

Create the ~/linkapp directory and put link.txt and linkff.sh file in there. If you'd like to create a command for linkff.sh, also create ~/bin and create a link to linkff.sh in ~/bin. Log out and log back in and ~/bin will be added to $PATH.

Put link.php in your apache document root (i.e. /var/www/ or /var/www/html depending on which linux flavor). This is the web page you will access from the client machine to paste the link into the html form.

This is the easiest way to get this working. The form will write the link to link.txt and you can execute it in firefox by running linkff.sh on the server.

However, the second part of the php script is way more awesome and it will automatically execute it in firefox. This is more difficult to make work, and is potentially a security risk (although I made it as secure as possible I think).

1. Add this line to sudoers (sudo visudo) (change {username{ to your user name without curly brackets:

www-data ALL=({username}) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/firefox

This will let you run firefox as yourself without entering a password.

2. You need to add www-data to your xwindows local server. Run this command:

xhost +local:www-data

After you do this, the php script will automatically execute the firefox command when you send the html form.

I know it's dirty, but it works for me.
